# Welcome

Welcome to the migrated version of **TheUnknownBlog**.  This site is built with
the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and hosted on
GitHub Pages.  It preserves the spirit of the original Astroâ€‘powered blog while
using a theme that is well supported by GitHub Pages.  Below you will find
recent posts as well as links to additional pages.

The original site featured a clean, pastel design with a focus on readable
content and a minimal navigation bar.  To approximate that aesthetic within
GitHub Pages, the `minima` theme has been selected for its simple layout and
support for blog posts, pages and RSS feeds.

All posts from the old site have been reproduced here with their original
publication dates.  Feel free to browse the archive, read the articles and
explore the About and Projects pages for more information about the author and
their work.
