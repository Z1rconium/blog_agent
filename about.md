# About

Hello!  I'm **TheUnknownThing**, a computer science student currently studying at
Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  Programming has been a passion of mine for as
long as I can remember – from tinkering with algorithms and data structures to
building applications and exploring systems programming.  I'm particularly
interested in concurrency, virtualization and tools that empower developers to
work more efficiently.

This blog began as a personal knowledge base where I recorded my learning
journey, solved technical problems and shared notes from classes and projects.
Over time it evolved into a fully fledged website with an elegant interface and
sections for blog posts, projects and an about page.  In May 2024 the site was
refactored using Astro and the Astro Pure theme, and by mid‑2025 it hosted
articles ranging from reinforcement learning summaries to system administration
tutorials and reflections on software design.  A timeline of significant
milestones is reproduced below:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| July 2024 | Abstracted the Astro site into a reusable theme and published it on GitHub. |
| July 2024 | Wrote documentation for the theme and shared it with the community. |
| May 2024 | Refactored the website using Astro and the Astro Theme Resume, adopting a fresh design and improved structure. |

## Site Resources

The original version of this site relied on a number of tools and services to
operate smoothly: the domain was managed through Vercel, the framework was
Astro with the **Astro Theme Pure**, hosting was provided by Vercel, and
continuous deployment was handled automatically via Vercel workflows and GitHub
Actions.  User comments were powered by Waline with Supabase as the backend,
and visitor statistics were gathered through Substats and Waline.

Now that the site has moved to GitHub Pages, it no longer depends on those
services.  Instead, the pages you see here are generated at build time by
Jekyll and delivered directly from GitHub's servers.  Comments and analytics
are not enabled by default in order to keep this new version simple and
lightweight.
