# Projects

Below are some of the projects I have worked on and featured on my original
blog.  These summaries reflect the descriptions and technologies from the
site's **Projects** section, where visitors could view pinned repositories and
explore my open source contributions.  Stars and language statistics are
approximate and may have changed since publication.

## vscode‑acmoj

This Visual Studio Code extension is designed to streamline the experience of
preparing and submitting ACMOJ problems.  It provides an integrated problem
list, one‑click code submission and a friendly user interface within VS Code.
The project uses TypeScript and Vue, and interacts with the ACMOJ API using
personal access tokens for authentication.

* **Language:** TypeScript/Vue
* **Stars:** ~260

## Campus Real Run

An experimental running game built with Unity that encourages students to stay
active by collecting virtual items scattered around their campus.  Players earn
points by exercising in the real world and can compete with friends on a
leaderboard.  The game demonstrates the integration of real‑world data into
gameplay mechanics.

* **Language:** C#/Unity
* **Stars:** ~38

## QUIC‑Transproxy

A transparent proxy implementation based on the QUIC protocol.  This project
allows TCP and UDP traffic to be relayed through a QUIC tunnel, improving
performance on high latency networks.  It was inspired by a desire to learn
about modern transport protocols and network programming.

* **Language:** Rust
* **Stars:** ~71

## Fantasy Advanced

An enhanced version of the Astro theme that powers the original blog.  It
includes custom components, refined styling and a set of utilities for building
personal websites quickly.  This theme formed the basis of the Astro site and
has been open‑sourced for others to reuse.

* **Language:** TypeScript/Astro
* **Stars:** ~53

## Additional Tools and Experiments

In addition to the pinned projects, I have explored various programming
languages, frameworks and techniques.  Some examples include:

* **OpenWRT Compilation Workflow** – A script and GitHub Actions pipeline for
  building custom OpenWRT images from the LEDE source tree, allowing the
  inclusion of specific packages and configuration options.
* **File Synchronization with lsyncd** – An exploration of real‑time file sync
  solutions, comparing `rsync` triggered by `inotify` with the `lsyncd` daemon
  and demonstrating how to configure SSH keys and logging.
* **GPU Passthrough on KVM** – A tutorial on enabling IOMMU in the BIOS,
  adjusting GRUB parameters and binding the GPU to the VFIO driver to achieve
  near‑native graphics performance in virtual machines.
