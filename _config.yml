# When using a builtâ€‘in theme on GitHub Pages, set the `theme` field. The `minima` theme
# provides a clean, minimal layout similar to the original site without requiring
# additional dependencies.
theme: minima

# Include the `jekyll-feed` plugin so RSS feeds are generated automatically. This
# mimics the feed functionality of the original Astro site.
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed

# List any Markdown pages that should appear in the top navigation. These
# correspond to the About and Projects sections on the original site.
header_pages:
  - about.md
  - projects.md

# Site URL and base URL are left blank because GitHub Pages will set them
# automatically based on the repository name. If deploying to a custom domain,
# update these values accordingly.
